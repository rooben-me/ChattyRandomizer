# Chatty Randomizer

## What is this?
This is a chatbot that randomly converts the characters in your messages to uppercase or lowercase. It's a fun way to have a conversation and add some unpredictability to your interactions.


## How does it work? 
The chatbot uses a simple algorithm to randomly convert the characters in your messages to uppercase or lowercase. This means that each time you send a message, the chatbot will respond with a different mix of capital and lowercase letters. It's like having a conversation with a robot version of a teenage hacker!

## How do I use it? 
To use Chatty Randomizer, simply run the Python script and start typing your messages. The chatbot will respond with a randomized version of your message. You can continue the conversation as long as you like.

To end the conversation and save the chat history to a CSV file, simply type "quit" (without quotes) as your message. This will save the conversation history to a file with a unique name based on the current date and time

## Why would I want to use this?
Well, why not? Chatty Randomizer is a fun and lighthearted way to have a conversation, and it's a good way to add some randomness to your interactions. Plus, you can save the conversation history as a memento or a reminder of your fun chat with the chatbot. 

##  Is there anything else I should know?
Yes, there is! The chatbot is not perfect and may sometimes produce unexpected or nonsensical responses. This is all part of the fun, and you should embrace the randomness and unpredictability of the chatbot. 

Also, the chatbot may sometimes take a little while to respond, especially if you're using an older computer or a slow internet connection. But don't worry, the chatbot is just thinking hard about the best way to respond to your message!
